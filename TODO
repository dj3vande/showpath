Documentation:
-Create sample config files (blocked on adding config file functionality)
-Possibly make user manual with more information on motivation and
    use cases to supplement man page?

Bugfixes:
	See BUGS section of manpage.

Features:
-Add configurable short names
  (e.g. we should be able to create a config file for a Mac
  installation so that 'showpath -tman %fink %current' outputs
  /sw/man (where fink keeps its manpages) prepended to $MANPATH,
  or moves it to the front if it's already in there somewhere.)

-Make '~' prefix on path_entries expand to $HOME

-Add capability to prune directories that do not exist
  (combined with the above to-do items, this will let the
  system config specify something like
		type exec
		{
			home = ~/bin;
			home = ~/bin-SunOS;
		}
  which allows users who have home directories shared between
  machines with different architectures to say 'PATH=`showpath
  %home %current`' and automagically get personal arch-specific
  bin directories if they exist, without cluttering up $PATH
  if they don't.)

-Make the path separator configurable
  (Windows likes to use ';')

-Split command-line args on separator instead of treating argv[i] as
  a single word
  (This would allow a use case like:
			oldpath=$PATH
			. /path/to/some/setup/script
			PATH=`showpath $oldpath %current`
  to force the new stuff added by a (presumably not your)
  setup script to go to the end of the path.)
