Documentation:
-Create sample config files (blocked on adding config file functionality)
-Possibly make user manual with more information on motivation and
    use cases to supplement man page?

Bugfixes:
	See BUGS section of manpage.

Features:
-Allow deprioritizing an item.
  showpath ~/bin %current moves it to the front if it's already there
  showpath %current ~/bin should move it to the end
 Dave's thoughts:
 I've been bouncing around the idea of having a magic prefix to
  REMOVE an entry.  ('-' is an obvious magic prefix in terms of
  mapping meaning of symbols to semantics, except that it's already
  the option prefix, and overloading it would be both confusing and
  difficult to implement.)
 If the remove is done in-order on the walk through the command
  line, deprioritizing could then be done by saying
    showpath %current -~/bin ~/bin
  (remove ~/bin from current (silently ignore if it's not there),
  then add it after what's left).

-Add configurable short names
  (e.g. we should be able to create a config file for a Mac
  installation so that 'showpath -tman %fink %current' outputs
  /sw/man (where fink keeps its manpages) prepended to $MANPATH,
  or moves it to the front if it's already in there somewhere.)

-Make '~' prefix on path_entries expand to $HOME

-Add capability to prune directories that do not exist
  (combined with the above to-do items, this will let the
  system config specify something like
		type exec
		{
			home = ~/bin;
			home = ~/bin-SunOS;
		}
  which allows users who have home directories shared between
  machines with different architectures to say 'PATH=`showpath
  %home %current`' and automagically get personal arch-specific
  bin directories if they exist, without cluttering up $PATH
  if they don't.)
