Documentation:
-Create sample config files (blocked on adding config file functionality)
-Possibly make user manual with more information on motivation and
    use cases to supplement man page?

Bugfixes:

Code cleanup:
-Find a better place to put the ~-expansion
  It's done on the inputs to insert_entry and remove_entry.
  From a "where does data go" point of view, this is the right place,
    since we want things to be expanded iff they go through this
    interface; but that's in code that was supposed to only do
    bookkeeping for inputs that had already had all the interpretation
    and rewriting they needed done.
  If we could get away with doing it at the output, that would be
    cleanest, but having multiple names for the same entry inside the
    path maintenance code breaks removal and duplicate pruning.
  Trying to do it at the front-end runs into problems with not having
    the outputs of path splitting and shortname expansion go through
    a single well-defined point we can do expansion at (other than
    insert_entry and remove_entry, but see above).

Features:
-Add configurable short names
  (e.g. we should be able to create a config file for a Mac
  installation so that 'showpath -tman %fink %current' outputs
  /sw/man (where fink keeps its manpages) prepended to $MANPATH,
  or moves it to the front if it's already in there somewhere.)

-Add capability to prune directories that do not exist
  (combined with the above to-do items, this will let the
  system config specify something like
		type exec
		{
			home = ~/bin;
			home = ~/bin-SunOS;
		}
  which allows users who have home directories shared between
  machines with different architectures to say 'PATH=`showpath
  %home %current`' and automagically get personal arch-specific
  bin directories if they exist, without cluttering up $PATH
  if they don't.)
