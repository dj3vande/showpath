Features/bugfixes:  See list in manpage

Documentation:
-Turn manpage into a proper man page instead of an ASCII-formated
  pseudo-manpage
-Create sample config files (blocked on adding config file functionality)
-Possibly make user manual with more information on motivation and
    use cases to supplement man page?

Code cleanup:
-Make envname local to main / arg to add_path instead of being global
  (Along with this, we can make the type table local to set_type.)
